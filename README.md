METRO MAP

This project contains a metro map in which all stations will be retrieved from a file and will be implemented 
using graph data structure. The basic idea is that a person enters his source and destination stations and the 
software computes the route, number of switches between metros and fare and displays them respectively. 
There is also an administrator page for the admin to insert or delete station  but this action is secured by some particular password.
We have also stored the contact details of every station, so that if they have any queries they could resolve them.
